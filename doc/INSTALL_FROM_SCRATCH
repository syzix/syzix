Bootstrapping Syzix
====================

Or, building Syzix From Scratch.

This is mainly useful if you want to install to somewhere other than /sw.
For most people, getting the basic /sw bootstrap archive and unpacking it
inside /sw should suffice.  These instructions describe installing to /sw,
but will work with any target, eg. $HOME.


1. Download the bf utility and syzlib.  Dump them somewhere temporary that's
   in your $PATH.  I use ~/bin because it's already in my $PATH.  You might
   prefer /usr/local/bin (if you don't mind working as root).


2. Download the bootstrap src pack, and unpack it inside your $TARGET (/sw in
   this case).

       TARGET="/sw"
       mkdir "$TARGET"
       cd "$TARGET"
       tar xf ~/syzix-bootstrap-src-0.1.tar.xz


3. Build the necessary base tools.

       BFPATH="$TARGET/syzix/src" bf build syz
       # Eventually this will be enough...
       #BFPATH="$TARGET/syzix/src" bf build syzix-core


4. Remove the temporary $TARGET/syzix/src and replace it with a symlink to the
   full syzix src collection.

       cd "$TARGET/syzix"
       rm -rf src
       ln -s noarch/syzix/default/src


5. Remove the temporary bf and syzlib.

       rm ~/bin/bf ~/bin/syzlib


6. (Optional) Create a convenience symlink for syzzyup.

       ln -s $TARGET/syzix/hostdep/noarch/syz/default/bin/syzzyup /syzzyup


7. Bootstrap syz into your current shell.

       . /syzzyup
   or
       . $TARGET/syzix/hostdep/noarch/syz/default/bin/syzzyup


8. (Optional) Setup your profile so that all shells have the syz command available.

       echo ". /syzzyup" >> /etc/profile
   or
       echo ". $TARGET/syzix/hostdep/noarch/syz/default/bin/syzzyup" >> /etc/profile


9. Start using the just-installed tools.

       syz load syzix-core


10. Now build the rest of the OS.

   If you're happy to have a host-dependent Syzix install (in the
   $TARGET/syzix/hostdep repo), then just start "bf build"ing the packages you're
   interested in (eg. "bf build syzix-full" will pull in everything).

   If you want a standalone system, then you'll first need to build a native
   Syzix toolchain, which is binutils, ld, glibc and gcc (and anything else?).
   This proceeds in much the same way as LFS, except it's simpler and more
   straightforward - at a conceptual level, the procedure is to build hostdep
   versions of each of these tools, and then using those (properly configured)
   versions from the hostdep repo (instead of the actual system-wide ones in /usr),
   rebuild them again into the actual $TARGET/syzix repo.
